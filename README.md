bugwords
========

Bugwd makes bug IDs easier to remember and to share out loud (in a meeting or
phone call, for example) by replacing numeric IDs with a sequence of words.

The word sequences are generated by Oren Tirosh's [mnemonic encoder][1].

Bugwd is currently hard-coded to link to bugs on bugzilla.mozilla.org.  (I'll
extend it to work with other sites soon.)  To see it in action, go to
[bugwd.com](http://bugwd.com) and paste a bug number or a bugzilla link,
then copy and share the bugwd.com link that it generates.
